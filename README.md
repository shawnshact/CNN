# Convolutional Neural Network for OpeNNdd (Active Site) project.
# This program provides a basic way to load lots of 2d images from a database and run them trough a simple CNN
# While it will not by any means be identical to OpenNNdd, this program will hopefully give helpful insight into the entire process required for building a neural network in tensorflow.
